# Youtube-Video-Downloader
This simple little project I developed for personal use and the use of family and friends. 

The application will download the highest resolution version of the video available and store it in the same directory the application is in.

The audio will also be duplicated into an mp3 file. This was done so that music can be loaded off of youtube onto an mp3 player. (I know mp3 players are old, but my parents asked me for it lol) 

If you want to use this: 

1. Download the python file
2. install pytube using "pip install pytube" 
3. "pip install pytube moviepy"
4. Then run the file in your terminal and paste the url of the youtube video into the appplication
5. Viola!
